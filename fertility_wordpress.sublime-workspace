Since 2006, there have been ten Louisiana couples chosen for the GIFT of HOPE and four babies have been born as a result.\n\nFollow the GIFT of HOPE on Facebook!\n\nCongratulations to our Gift of Hope 2013 winners, Michelle & Chad Taylor! Read more about our Gift of Hope 2013 winners by clicking HERE!\n\nHopeBirth200\"We started the program as a way to help local couples undergo IVF who could not otherwise afford it,\" said Amelie Storment, the wife of Dr. Storment and the creator and driving force behind the program.\n\n\"We had been approached in 2005 by a national foundation that was doing a similar program. Their program awarded an IVF cycle to a deserving couple somewhere in the U.S. and then they would fly them to participating donating clinics around the country to receive treatment. We liked the idea, but following Hurricane Katrina, we knew that there were just as many deserving couples right here in our area who could use this service.\"\n\nOut of this simple idea, the Gift of Hope program was born.\n\nCreated to ease the high costs, both financially and emotionally, of in vitro fertilization (IVF), the GIFT of HOPE program awards infertility treatments to one couple each year who demonstrates both financial and medical needs for the procedure. Donors include John M. Storment, M.D., a board certified reproductive endocrinologist with Fertility & Women's Health Center of Louisiana, Women's & Children's Hospital in Lafayette, LA, and Sheridan Healthcare, anesthesia providers.\n\nGiftofHope-GraceAnnbirth_200The combined value of donated services to receive the GIFT of  HOPE is estimated at $10,000 to $15,000. According to Resolve, the National Infertility Association, only a quarter of healthcare insurers offer coverage for infertility care. As a result, as many as 50 percent of American couples who fail to conceive do not seek treatment due to financial reasons.\n\nGiftofHope-Jaggerbirth_150John Storment M.D. with Fertility & Women's Health Center of Louisiana offers comprehensive treatment of infertility, including Assistant Reproductive Technologies and In Vitro Fertilization, treatment of multiple pregnancy loss, endometriosis, and all other reproductive endocrine disorders, routine gynecologic care and menopause management. Women's & Children's Hospital offers quality cost-effective healthcare services for the women and children of Acadiana. Sheridan Healthcare offers the finest, most consistent teams of physicians and healthcare specialists to hospitals, ambulatory surgical facilities and healthcare providers.\n\nCLICK HERE for Gift of Hope FAQs\n\nCLICK HERE to Email Questions to Gift of Hope\n\n",
